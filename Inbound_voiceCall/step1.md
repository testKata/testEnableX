To start with

This example contains instructions how users can initiate Outbound Calls using EnableX Voice APIs.

Here we shall create a simple webserver using NodeJS and a browser page to enter phone numbers to be dialed.

From this webpage, you would need to enter from (outbound  number) that you would have configured through your portal and the destination number.

To see how to configure the outbound number please see :

Prerequisite:
